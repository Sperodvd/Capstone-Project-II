# American Sign Language classification utilizing Convolutonal Neural Network

#### Abstract
Sign language is a system of communication utilizing visual gestures and signs to convey meaning and is expressed through manual articulations in combination with non-manual elements. Conversion and classification of the sign languages have been long standing problem in the field of research specifically in computer vision. This project overviews recognition and classification performance of a model based on convolutional neural network (CNN) for hand gesture images considered in ASL (American Sign Language). The dataset considered for this project is provided by MNIST and it is publicly available at Kaggle and uses 24 hand gesture images which maps to English alphabets A-Z. The dataset contains 27455 training images and 7172 test images all with a shape of 28 by 28 pixels.
